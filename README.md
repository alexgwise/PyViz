The initial San Fran real estate code and analysis is located in the starter code folder, file name "rental_analysis_hw.ipynb"
The dashboard built to display the resulting graphs is located in the starter code folder, file name "rental_dashboard_hw.ipynb"

During December 2nd's office hours, I showed how the ylim set for the Top 10 Most Expensive Neighborhoods graph works properly, but then does not retain the y ranges when moved into Panel. Everything else went well. Thanks for a very useful activity!
